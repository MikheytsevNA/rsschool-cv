## Summary
* I have spent 6 years of study in the field of interaction of intense laser radiation with plasma.
* The most exiting part for me there was implement solutions for different related problems.
* Now I'm looking forward to learn a new intersting code language.
## Hard skills
* C++, MATLAB, Julia - on a basic level knowledge.
* Python with Jupyter notebooks - intermediate level regarding signal processing, visualisation and data analysis.
* Experience using supercomputer sustems as a tool of research.
## Education
MSc Physics degree at Lobachevsky State University of Nizhniy Novgorod at radiophysics department.
hesis: "Generation of radiation in the mid-infrared range upon reflection of a relativistically strong laser pulse from the plasma boundary"
## Code example
```
def bouncing_ball(h, bounce, window):
    
    if (window<h and h>0 and bounce<1 and bounce >0):
        i = 1# counter
        new_h = h #height of every new bounce
    else:
        return -1
    while new_h>window:
        if new_h*bounce> window:
            i+=2
            new_h*=bounce
        else:
            break
    return i
```
