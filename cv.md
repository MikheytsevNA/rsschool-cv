## Summary
* I have spent 6 years of study in the field of interaction of intense laser radiation with plasma.
* The most exiting part for me there was implement solutions for different related problems.
* Now I'm looking forward to learn a new intersting code language.
## Hard skills
* C++, MATLAB, Julia - on a basic level knowledge.
* Python with Jupyter notebooks - intermediate level regarding signal processing, visualisation and data analysis.
* Experience using supercomputer sustems as a tool of research.
## Education
* MSc Physics degree at Lobachevsky State University of Nizhniy Novgorod at radiophysics department.
  Thesis :"Generation of radiation in the mid-infrared range upon re lection of a relativistically strong laser pulse from the plasma boundary"
## Code example
```
l = subprocess.check_output(['find', '.', "-name", "LinearPolarization*.bin"], cwd = folder_name)
folders = l.split()
folders.sort()
folders = [i.decode('ascii') for i in folders]
print(folders[:])
i=0
with open(folder_name + "/{}".format(folders[0]), "rb") as f:
        bite = f.read(4)
        while bite:
            i+=1
            bite = f.read(4)
num_t = int(i/6)
num_n = len(folders)
```
